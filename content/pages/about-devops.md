![Pipeline-Image]({static}/images/pipeline.jpg)

DevOps is the practice of integrating both development and operations to ensure rapid deployment to production. By automating practices and using tools, business' and organizations can use a DevOps minset to enforce the rapid delivery of products to customers. 

Before DevOps and even now, some organizations have two bricked wall teams, Development and Operations. In the Software Development Lifecycle, management receives features and requirements from customers which are pushed to the Development to integrate in the Dev Environment which is finally forked to the Operations team to push to the production environment. 

However, since there are discrepancies between Production and Dev environments, it can cause significant unexpected unplanned work for QA, Dev and Operations causing the deployment of the product to be slowed down. The implementation of DevOps reduces discrepancies, increases communication by breaking down silos and focuses on delivering products at a rapid velocity.
